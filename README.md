Dear Zylann,

 I've got the shader working so I've included a test demo. My little girl was so happy she spent all morning making terrain and when she made the mountains and hte snow she went "BRRR its cold Daddy".
 Also I've temporarily put a decels on/off tickbox so you can turn the meshed grass/trees/daisies/concblocks on and off.
 My plan is to work on some mesher functions namely to re-index the seams, reimplement the post process seamfixer but before I can do that the plan is to move all the grass tree daisy stuff into its own cpp/h file called height_map_decels.x
 Anyway I want to thank you for all the hard work and effor you've put into this project too I couldn't have done it without you. I really hope Reduz adds it to Godot and gives us credit for all the hard work we've done.

 Cheers -- HumanSheeple
