Dear Zylann,
 I have done as you have asked and I have re-written the mesher so that all the vertexes are made in one go and the indices are the only thing that changes. I must admit I have noticed a marginal improvement in performance already writing it this way. I hope you appreciate all the time and effort I have put into this project.
 Kind Regards
